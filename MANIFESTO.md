## Introduction
In today's data-driven world, the exchange of personal data is becoming increasingly prevalent. As technology advances and new standards emerge, it is vital to ensure that individual rights and privacy are adequately safeguarded. Our primary purpose is to define the existing mechanisms through which International Data Spaces (IDS) handles situations involving personal data and to envision how it should evolve to be more human-centric.


It is imperative to empower individuals not only to control and understand their personal data but also to derive personal and collective benefits from them. This manifesto, while deeply inspired by [MyData Global's Declaration](https://www.mydata.org/participate/declaration/), aligns with the objectives of the [Personal Data and IDS Sub Working Group](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/Personal-Data-and-IDS), advocating for a human-centric and empowering data-sharing environment, as well as promoting data sovereignty of individuals over their data.

## Vision
We envision a digital society where individuals are at the center/forefront, able to have sovereignty over their data, understanding the implications and potential benefits of data sharing, and actively participating in the benefits yielded from their data.

## Mission
Our mission is to explore and understand the intersection between the  IDS standard and the realm of personal data sharing. We aim to enhance the IDS's human-centric approach, identifying and addressing gaps to improve its effectiveness and inclusivity regarding personal data.

We are dedicated to deepening our understanding of how IDS integrates personal data considerations and proposing practical solutions to overcome these challenges. Ensuring interoperability is also crucial, applying technologies like [MyData](https://www.mydata.org/), [IDS](https://internationaldataspaces.org/), and [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) from a personal data perspective.

Lastly, we seek to define the role of personal data intermediaries within IDS, placing individuals at the center of the data-sharing process, making it efficient, empowering, and inclusive for all.

## Objectives
**Deep Understanding**: Delve into the IDS standard's handling of personal data, identifying gaps and proposing solutions for seamless integration.

**Human-Centric Approach**: Advocate for and implement practices where individuals have control, transparency, understanding, and the ability to derive benefits from their personal data within the IDS ecosystem.

**Collaborative Exploration**: Work collaboratively to explore the intersection of IDS standards and personal data, proposing inclusive and practical solutions to identified challenges.


## Principles
### 1. Empowered Individuals
Individuals should have actionable rights over their personal data within an IDS-compliant ecosystem, with easy-to-use tools and services that allow for control, understanding, and benefit-sharing. Promote transparency, informed consent, and easy access to personal data rights.

### 2. Data Security and Sovereignty
Beyond data security, individuals should be empowered to utilize data held about them for various purposes, including making their lives easier, self-improvement, decision-making, and data sharing under their terms within the IDS framework.

### 3. Open Ecosystems & Interoperability
Advocate for open ecosystems where data flows freely, decided by individuals, promoting balance, fairness, and competition in the digital economy. Ensure interoperability within the IDS by applying technologies like MyData, IDS, Solid from a personal data perspective, allowing for secure and efficient data sharing and utilization.

### 4. Transparency & Accountability
Organizations, particularly those acting as data controllers under the GDPR, bear significant and primary responsibility for the personal data they handle. They must:

-	Have a legal ground to disclose personal data 
-	Consider anonymizing data where appropriate to protect individualsâ€™ privacy.
-	To take care that the data subjects rights can be enforced 
-	To provide the appropriate technical and organisational means/mechanisms to guarantee GDPR compliance

In addition to these responsibilities, organizations should commit to transparency and accountability in their data practices. This commitment involves providing clear and understandable privacy terms and policies, thereby allowing individuals to have control and sovereignty over the use of their data. Through these practices, organizations not only comply with legal standards but also build trust with individuals whose data they handle.
